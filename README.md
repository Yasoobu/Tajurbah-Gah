Game Development Project
To run this project, you need the latest version of Unity which is available for free on Unity's official website. Open this project in Unity and click run.

This is a 3D physics practical simulation developed in Unity.
It simulates the very well known practical of finding the density of an object heavier than water using the Archimedes Principle.

On launching, the user is welcomed with a screen that is a guide on how to perform the experiment. It has 3 tabs which the user can naviagte through and read the concepts used in the experiment and the information required to perform the experiment correctly. The user can then click the start button to open the screen where the actual experiment will be performed.
On starting, the user is displayed a 3d room with a table placed in the centre and a joystick at the corner of the screen to rotate the camera to have better viewing angles.
The screen has multiple icons to either pause the experiment or go back to the home screen etc.
On the left side of the screen there is a button labelled "Steps". Upon clicking it, the box appears which shows the steps the user will have to perform along with the experiment.
On top of the screen, there is a repository containing the experiment intruments that the user will need to perform the experiment. These can be dragged and dropped on the table as needed. 
The current step that the user has to perform in highlighted in the steps box on the left. As the user completes the step successfully, that setp is automatically striked through and the next step is highlighted. This was the user doesn't have to manually remember which step to perform and how to do it.

Upon the successful completion of the experiment, the user can click the button appearing on the right corner labelled as "Go to Questions". Clicking this button takes the user to the post experiment module where they are presented with a set of questions and space to answer them. In case the user ca't figure out the right answe, they can click the button labelled "Hint" being displayed at the botton of the screen. This takes them to another screen which contains a hint on how to solve that particular quaetion. The user can then click the back button to go back to the quedtion and correctly answer it.

The app exits after the user has answered all questions and chooses the "Finish" option on the last screen.
